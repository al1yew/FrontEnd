        standard dummy text ever since the 1500 <sup>s</sup>, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and

        electronic typesetting, remaining good.</p>

        To <i>Sherlock Holmes</i> she is always the woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In
        his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene
        Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind.
        He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he
        would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a
        sneer. They were admirable things for the observerâ€”excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives and
        actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted
        temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in
        a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a
        strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late
        Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.

    <h3>How to peel potatoes using a peeler, paring knife, or boiling to peel?!</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Wash your potatoes under cold water
        </li>
        <li>
            Use a hand peeler.
        </li>
        <li>
            Let them boil until they tender.
        </li>
        <li>
            Hold the potato in your non-dominant hand and the peeler in your dominant hand and swipe the peeler against
            the potato going away from your body.
        </li>
        <li>
            Like with a peeler hold the potato in your non-dominant hand and the paring knife in your other hand. Using
            your thumb as a guide slide the knife along the potato just under the skin. Work your way around the potato
            until it is all peeled.
        </li>
        <li>
            Score the washed potatoes just enough to get through the skin all the way around the potato. Then place them
            into a pot with boiling water and let them boil until they are tender.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>First of all you need ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            1 potato
        </li>
        <li>
            peeler
        </li>
        <li>
            water
        </li>
        <li>
            something else
        </li>
        <li>
            maybe another potatooo potato potato
        </li>
